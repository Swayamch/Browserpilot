# BrowserPilot Extension Icons

Chrome requires PNG icons. To generate them from the SVG:

1. Open `icon128.svg` in a browser
2. Screenshot / export at 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128
3. Save as `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`

Or use an online tool like https://convertio.co/svg-png/

For development, you can temporarily edit manifest.json to remove the icon references.
